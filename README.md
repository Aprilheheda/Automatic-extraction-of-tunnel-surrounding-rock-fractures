# Automatic-extraction-of-tunnel-surrounding-rock-fractures
This code can realize the automatic extraction of rock fractures, which consists of FPD-net and IPPT.
Fracture extraction consists of two stages: 1. Fracture point detection: using the FPD-net to detect fracture points in the 3D point cloud; 2. fracture point connection: based on the fracture point detection results, the IPPT is further applied to connect discrete fracture points into complete fractures.
